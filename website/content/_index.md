**This website is a collection of resources and simple code examples demonstrating how to visualize data and draw graphics using C# and .NET technologies.** Rather than fragment this content across various articles on [my blog](https://swharden.com/blog/) I decided to collect everything on this small website and pair it with my [C# Data Visualization GitHub project](https://github.com/swharden/Csharp-Data-Visualization).
